This repository contains all the exciting javascript challenge projects

1: PASSANGER COUNTER APP
      It is a very tedious task to count the passangers arriving in the station one by one. Sometimes we can loose the track of the passangers as they arrive in batches.
      It is hard to count the total number of passangers entering the station at the end of the day.
      This app helps count the batches of passangers , it keeps the track of number of passangers in each batch and simultaneously gives the total number of passangers.
2: FOOTBALL SCORE BOARD 
      Football game is for 45 minutes + 15 minute break + 45 minutes. Thus, the game lasts for 90 Minutes
      This Score board gives the number of Goals hit by each team. There are two teams playing , the HOME team and the AWAY/GUEST team
      This Score board also has a timer of 45 minutes which stops after 1 game slot
      (Here for conviennce I have set the timer to just 1 minute)
